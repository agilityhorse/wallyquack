<section>
<h2>1. Summary</h2>
<p>Wally Quack is a casual mobile game. The app <strong>does not collect personal data</strong> by the developer. The game uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads; AdMob may independently collect device identifiers and other information as described below.</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>2. What we collect</h2>
<p><strong>Developer-collected data:</strong> None. The developer does not request or store names, email addresses, location, photos, or other personal identifiers.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party data (AdMob / Google):</strong> AdMob may collect certain information automatically, such as advertising identifiers (e.g. Google Advertising ID), device information, IP address, and information about ad interactions. This data is collected and processed by Google according to Google’s privacy policies (see links below).</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>3. Internet & Offline use</h2>
<p>Wally Quack may request permission to access the internet for the sole purpose of loading and showing advertisements. Core gameplay is available <strong>offline</strong> and does not require an internet connection.</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>4. Audience & Children</h2>
<p>The game is intended for users aged <strong>7 years and older in the European Union</strong> and <strong>9 years and older in the United States</strong>. The developer does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information through the app, please contact us at the address below.</p>
<div class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Because the game displays ads via AdMob, Google may serve or collect certain non-personal and behavioral information as described in Google’s own policies. If your child is under the age required by local laws (for example under 13 in the United States), please review AdMob/Google policy and the app’s settings for parental controls.
</div>
</section>


<section>
<h2>5. Third-party services</h2>
<p>We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to monetize the game. AdMob is a third-party service and its use may involve data collection for ad personalization, analytics, and fraud prevention. We do not control how AdMob uses data; please review Google's documentation for details.</p>
